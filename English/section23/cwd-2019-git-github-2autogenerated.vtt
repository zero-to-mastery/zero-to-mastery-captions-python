WEBVTT

00:00.660 --> 00:01.610
Welcome back.

00:01.620 --> 00:10.890
Let's continue from our previous video to talk about a more advanced workflow and get and get hub now

00:10.980 --> 00:12.240
up to this point.

00:12.390 --> 00:16.410
Both Marcy and I have just been working on over here.

00:16.410 --> 00:19.230
Branch Master what does that mean.

00:19.230 --> 00:27.190
Well it says branches but I only see master here and you might have noticed one issue with the way that

00:27.190 --> 00:28.630
we were doing things.

00:28.630 --> 00:34.050
That is if it's my first day on the job and I just change the title.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.980
But maybe we'd even want that change.

00:35.980 --> 00:40.280
Maybe that breaks our branding or breaks our app.

00:40.540 --> 00:44.350
But I was able to do it so easily to change it into master.

00:44.350 --> 00:47.680
Maybe Marcy didn't even know that I've added that change.

00:47.680 --> 00:48.800
And that's a big problem right.

00:48.810 --> 00:54.310
You don't want to put things into what we call production into what the user sees.

00:54.310 --> 00:59.770
If it's going to break our Web site if you're a big company like Facebook that could mean millions of

00:59.770 --> 01:06.940
dollars in lost revenue even if you have a bug that lasts a few hours so I'm going to show you a more

01:06.940 --> 01:09.310
realistic workflow that you'll have.

01:09.310 --> 01:17.630
And that is with branching to show you what I mean I have over here a visual of what good is really

01:17.630 --> 01:18.820
really good.

01:18.830 --> 01:25.040
Up until now we've been working on what we call master that is the master branch think of the master

01:25.040 --> 01:28.160
branch as the authority.

01:28.220 --> 01:34.370
This is the right way that our app or our Web site should look and up until now.

01:34.370 --> 01:44.230
When I did the cool background title Well I went from background generator to cool generator.

01:44.540 --> 01:50.450
And then when Marci changed it to capitalized letters then we went to here and we just went in a linear

01:50.450 --> 01:53.990
fashion from one end to the other to the other to the other.

01:53.990 --> 01:56.430
But like I said that is a bit of a problem.

01:56.450 --> 02:03.020
So a better thing to do is what we call branching if I wanted to change the title I will create a branch

02:03.710 --> 02:06.300
and just call it little feature for example.

02:06.830 --> 02:15.910
And I just work on that branch on my own without affecting the master branch what the user sees only

02:15.910 --> 02:16.950
when it's finished.

02:16.960 --> 02:23.770
When Marci has reviewed it when we have tested it and everybody on the team is OK then we bring it back

02:23.890 --> 02:30.920
into master and you can see over here with the big feature you can keep going for a long time on your

02:30.920 --> 02:38.120
own branch and only when you're done do what we call merge into master.

02:38.180 --> 02:39.580
I'm going to show you how that works today.

02:41.260 --> 02:49.620
I'm going to close this and remember our example we have Marcy's computer here with all the files and

02:49.620 --> 02:57.990
we have my computer here with all the files we both have our workstation setup and now you see what

02:58.170 --> 03:03.750
Master in my terminal means and I'll show you in the notes afterwards how you can have this setup.

03:03.750 --> 03:08.610
So it tells you what branch you're on but we can see that we're both on Master.

03:08.610 --> 03:09.720
That's my computer.

03:09.840 --> 03:12.760
And Marcy's computer is also on Master.

03:12.870 --> 03:18.380
We want to make sure that we're both up to date with the latest GitHub.

03:18.420 --> 03:22.860
So Marcy's gonna do get pull and I'm also going to do get Paul

03:26.420 --> 03:33.050
and let's say that I'm now working on a new feature and because it's a better workflow not to work on

03:33.060 --> 03:40.910
Master and this is a good tip generally don't work on master always branch off if I do get branch they'll

03:40.910 --> 03:46.430
show me that well I only have one branch and that is master but we can add to it and we can say get

03:46.520 --> 03:52.780
branch new or little feature.

03:52.780 --> 03:59.950
And now if I do get branch I see that I have little feature but Master is highlighted because I'm currently

03:59.950 --> 04:01.050
a master.

04:01.150 --> 04:11.110
So the way I would go to the little feature branch I'll say get check out little feature and there you

04:11.110 --> 04:16.270
go switch to branch a little feature and now I'm on little feature branch.

04:16.270 --> 04:26.220
So what I've done is I've branched off of master and now created a little feature let's create a bit

04:26.220 --> 04:32.250
of a change I'm going to say in the little feature we're going to change the current RSS background

04:32.250 --> 04:36.840
title to say this is the background

04:40.960 --> 04:49.210
I'm going to save here and again I do my simple workflow that we did in the last video get status I

04:49.210 --> 04:53.590
see that yeah we have the index that a simple change point clear so we can see.

04:53.590 --> 05:02.660
So now that we've made this change let's do get add and again just get status to make sure everything

05:02.660 --> 05:03.370
went through.

05:03.410 --> 05:06.030
Yeah we're ready to commit index out a symbol.

05:06.050 --> 05:14.270
So we'll do get commit message we'll be changing text perfect.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.170
Let's clear that.

05:16.170 --> 05:21.960
And now again in order to let get have know of the changes we need to get push.

05:22.070 --> 05:23.850
So we'll do get push

05:30.020 --> 05:37.490
let's go to get hub and see what happened we see that now we have this a yellow bar that just showed

05:37.490 --> 05:44.500
up and says You recently pushed branches so if I click on this green button here compare pull request

05:47.780 --> 05:55.130
it shows me what changes I have which is I've changed a title and here I can let Marci know saying Marci

05:55.970 --> 05:59.720
I've changed the text.

05:59.750 --> 06:03.370
What do you think and I click on Create pull request

06:06.430 --> 06:11.350
and now I have my PR and you see here how says merge pull requests.

06:11.380 --> 06:18.490
Well if we go back to our diagram I've created this little feature and now I'm saying Hey Marcy I've

06:18.640 --> 06:20.680
just done this new change.

06:20.740 --> 06:21.700
What do you think.

06:21.730 --> 06:25.130
Is it OK for me to merge it into M..

06:25.330 --> 06:31.040
And what will happen here most likely is Marcy's will come see this pull request.

06:31.180 --> 06:36.100
You can see that we're on the pull request apps so she'll be able to see them and seeing oh Andre just

06:36.250 --> 06:44.770
did this change she'll look through the changes and she'll say hmm hmm well if she likes this she can

06:44.770 --> 06:52.050
be like looks good she can click on Start a review and you know what she would like says Look she's

06:52.060 --> 06:53.170
just going to approve

07:01.260 --> 07:03.990
now Marcy or myself.

07:03.990 --> 07:08.580
Usually you don't want to merge your own poll requests somebody on the team does it can now just say

07:09.180 --> 07:13.340
March poll request confirm merge.

07:13.460 --> 07:21.110
And there you go sometimes like deleting the branch afterwards so you can just click delete here if

07:21.110 --> 07:23.270
I go back to the code.

07:23.370 --> 07:28.700
Well I don't have the branches anymore because I just deleted it but in my master if I go to index out

07:28.710 --> 07:32.350
a symbol I see this is the background.

07:32.410 --> 07:37.750
So now Marcy can go to her project and say get pull

07:40.630 --> 07:47.010
and again she has the latest update.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.970
Now let's talk about some conflicts second arise.

07:50.070 --> 07:57.070
Now let's say Marcy wants to change something and I also change this same thing and we get a merge conflict.

07:57.150 --> 07:58.400
Let's see what happens.

07:58.440 --> 08:05.520
So let's say Marcy wants to change create a new feature saying we'll call this one big feature and she'll

08:05.520 --> 08:09.740
say get check out or get branch.

08:09.810 --> 08:23.070
Big feature she'll say get check out big feature and if I do get branch we see that there's a new branch

08:23.070 --> 08:23.520
here.

08:23.520 --> 08:29.970
Let's clear that and she'll say here that she wants to change this back to background color or background

08:29.970 --> 08:34.400
generator because all the users are complaining that the title changed and they like the all time.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.030
So she's changed that.

08:36.420 --> 08:42.840
She has done the get ad get to commit

08:45.440 --> 08:54.320
reverting back to old title perfect and then she's going to do get push.

08:54.620 --> 08:57.050
Let's clear that first actually.

08:57.050 --> 09:03.850
And we do get push first time you get this you might get this Sara saying that there's no upstream you

09:03.880 --> 09:10.660
just copy the code that they give you here.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.430
Perfect.

09:11.430 --> 09:22.330
Now if I go back to background generator I see the big feature pull request over here and just to show

09:22.330 --> 09:24.430
you that you can have multiple comments.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.890
Let's say Marcy decides to.

09:26.890 --> 09:27.740
Oh this is me.

09:27.760 --> 09:30.580
Marcy decides to add an exclamation point here.

09:30.580 --> 09:34.090
She can just say again she saves this.

09:34.090 --> 09:40.080
That's clear she'll say get ad get connect.

09:40.260 --> 09:44.590
You do this a lot so you get really really good a get after working the company for a while.

09:44.970 --> 09:53.350
And she'll say added X exclamation whoops I want I want to do get commit

09:55.840 --> 10:01.370
commit added exclamation

10:03.740 --> 10:05.830
and she'll do get push again.

10:09.980 --> 10:18.120
Let's go back to get up if we look at the pull request they'll actually have both of these vert back

10:18.120 --> 10:21.130
to all title and added exclamation.

10:21.360 --> 10:27.900
And we see over here both of the changes create the pull request needs changes.

10:27.900 --> 10:28.290
ANDRE

10:31.010 --> 10:39.490
So while this pull request is out there I decided to start a new branch call.

10:39.490 --> 10:41.140
Let's just call it conflict for now

10:44.330 --> 10:47.450
and I'll get check out conflict

10:49.990 --> 11:02.550
now in the conflict branch I decided to change this to just completely remove the call generator.

11:03.150 --> 11:11.210
I save that again I check my status and index start a simple file has been changed.

11:11.350 --> 11:21.320
So while this is happening I get Marcy to merge the pull request so she's entered into M..

11:21.670 --> 11:30.240
Her parole request is in and now if I go back to my conflict I do get status and we have to add these

11:30.240 --> 11:34.170
so get ad then get commit.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.530
I'll just do a short message here.

11:35.540 --> 11:50.180
Just check and now if I go back to master I have to do get checkout master again before I push my changes

11:50.180 --> 11:56.330
I want to make sure that I have the latest version of a master so I'm not changing anything I won't

11:56.330 --> 12:10.000
have any conflicts so I'll do get pool to get the latest and now I go to get check out conflict branch

12:12.510 --> 12:22.270
and I can do this command get merge master so I'm saying merge whatever Zen Master into conflict

12:25.660 --> 12:28.590
Marcy has been working on the big feature and she's merged it.

12:28.600 --> 12:34.120
So now Master has the big feature branch.

12:34.230 --> 12:41.780
I've also created another branch and I've been working on my own on the conflict branch and the conflict

12:41.780 --> 12:47.120
branch doesn't know anything about master so I'm saying hey whatever is in master right now which includes

12:47.450 --> 12:49.910
the big feature that Marcy worked on.

12:50.060 --> 12:53.460
Pull it in and make sure that there's no conflict.

12:53.570 --> 13:00.710
So I do that and oh I get conflict merge conflict and index not a shame offer.

13:00.830 --> 13:09.320
Now if I actually click on Sublime Text let me open the subsidy can see a better oh boy I get this weird

13:09.440 --> 13:18.340
little syntax it's overwhelming at first but it's easy to see what happening head is where my branches

13:18.340 --> 13:18.580
at.

13:19.060 --> 13:28.060
And it shows me that here to the end I don't have the H one anymore but in the master branch we have

13:28.450 --> 13:36.360
background generator now I can talk to Marcy and say Hey Marcy do you want to keep the back on generator.

13:36.360 --> 13:38.970
Title and she'll say yes.

13:38.970 --> 13:40.760
That was the right thing to do.

13:40.890 --> 13:42.540
Don't change the background.

13:42.540 --> 13:45.420
Well in that case I just remove these lines

13:49.060 --> 13:59.590
and remove this and save now if I do get status now OK.

13:59.610 --> 14:01.780
We have the modified status here.

14:01.830 --> 14:05.070
Let me just make this smaller again so you can see.

14:05.070 --> 14:06.600
Let me clear this.

14:07.050 --> 14:13.800
What we do now is we have to do get ad again because we made those changes and we have to do get commit

14:14.760 --> 14:17.190
fixing the merge issue.

14:19.970 --> 14:21.500
And I forgot the MLS share that again

14:27.980 --> 14:31.160
conflict fixing marriage issue.

14:31.220 --> 14:38.400
Let's clear here and do get status nothing to command working to clean.

14:38.430 --> 14:42.840
And if I do get push Well again I get this error.

14:42.840 --> 14:47.760
But I want to show you this time around if I didn't get the push origin conflict

14:51.340 --> 14:53.210
it now works.

14:53.420 --> 14:58.630
Let's go back to get hub see what sort of things we have.

14:58.630 --> 15:05.590
We have the conflict branch and if we look at the conflict branch now well there's nothing changed because

15:05.590 --> 15:08.620
well I just reverted all my changes so it's completely empty.

15:08.620 --> 15:18.370
There's no changes now so Marcy would be like hey did you mean to to make this PR.

15:18.910 --> 15:25.760
It's empty I'll see this message on my PR and I can keep going.

15:25.830 --> 15:33.770
And that's pretty much the workflow that you'll see in get a lead the commands for you after this but

15:33.810 --> 15:38.880
you see it's very very nice to work with you learn a few commands and as long as you have this visual

15:38.880 --> 15:45.660
model of every time you're working on something you always create a branch you title it with whatever

15:45.660 --> 15:55.290
feature you're working on and every once in a while you want to pull master and merge master into your

15:55.290 --> 16:00.360
branch to make sure that you're not missing out on any updates that other developers or teammates have

16:00.360 --> 16:03.460
done once you're done with your feature.

16:03.570 --> 16:12.120
You make a pull request by doing get push and that pull request your add comments and people will review

16:12.120 --> 16:17.430
your file changes and if they want you to make a few changes then you can do again get add get commit

16:17.880 --> 16:24.300
finally make your changes and then you can merge pull request and once that's done then everybody else

16:24.300 --> 16:25.220
on the team.

16:25.320 --> 16:26.830
There's now a new master.

16:26.850 --> 16:30.270
So everybody else on the team should do get Paul as well.

16:31.190 --> 16:37.220
It does takes a bit of time to get used to but is a really really nice workflow to make sure that everybody

16:37.370 --> 16:44.480
on the team works on the same files same projects without causing any errors and making sure that everybody

16:44.480 --> 16:45.550
collaborates.

16:45.650 --> 16:48.790
Well and that's it.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.230
Hope you found this useful.

16:50.230 --> 16:51.490
I'll see you in the next one.

16:51.550 --> 16:51.900
Bye bye.
